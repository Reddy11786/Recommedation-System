# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System with TMDB Dataset

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** built using data from **The Movie Database (TMDB)**. It combines and processes information from `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` to suggest movies based on textual similarity of overviews, cast, crew, genres, and keywords.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering** using TF-IDF vectorization of movie overviews
- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to compute similarity between movies
- 🧩 Combined and cleaned data from multiple CSV files (movies + credits)
- 🛠️ Easy-to-extend modular Python code for deeper recommendation models
- 📈 Ideal for learning feature extraction, vector similarity, and data wrangling
